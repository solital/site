INDEX_LOGIN='solital_index_login' Defining the routes You can define dashboard and login routes. The dashboard route will be for when the user authenticates, and the login route will be for when the user logs off and will be redirected to it. To do this, open the auth.yaml file and edit the auth_dashboard_url and auth_login_url variables. auth: auth_dashboard_url: /dashboard auth_login_url: /auth Setting For this, it is necessary to first define the name of the table in the login method. In the columns method, the database username and password. Then, in the values method, the input values of the form. Finally, the register method will perform the login as shown below. $res = Auth::login('auth_users') ->columns('username', 'password') ->values('inputEmail', 'inputPassword') ->register(); The $res variable will return true if authentication is true. But if it is false , you can add a reply message after the above code if authentication fails. if ($res == false) { message('login', 'Invalid username and/or password!'); response()->redirect('your_login_url'); } Below is an example method of authentication. <?php namespace Solital\\Components\\Controller; use Solital\\Core\\Http\\Controller\\Controller; use Solital\\Core\\Auth\\Auth; class UserController extends Controller { /** * @return void */ public function authPost(): void { $res = Auth::login('auth_users') ->columns('username', 'password') ->values('inputEmail', 'inputPassword') ->register(); if ($res == false) { message('login', 'Invalid username and/or password!'); response()->redirect(url('auth')); } } } Changing default routes If you need more routes for dashboards and logins, you can change the parameter in the register() function: # In routers.php Course::get('/my-second-dashboard', 'SiteController@SecondDashboard')->name('second.dashboard'); # In Controller $res = Auth::login('auth_users') ->columns('username', 'password') ->values('inputEmail', 'inputPassword') ->register(url('second.dashboard')); # Or $res = Auth::login('auth_users') ->columns('username', 'password') ->values('inputEmail', 'inputPassword') ->register('/my-second-dashboard'); Check login To ensure that the user is authenticated, use the Auth::isNotLogged() method. If the login has not been validated, the user will be redirected to the route defined in the auth.yaml file or to the /login route. /** * @return mixed */ public function dashboard(): mixed { Auth::isNotLogged(); return view('dashboard'); } To ensure that the user doesn't fall into the login route when it has already been validated, insert the Auth::isLogged() method in your login route. This method will redirect the user to your system's dashboard. /** * @return mixed */ public function auth(): mixed { Auth::isLogged(); return view('login'); } Logoff To logoff, use the Auth::logoff() method. /** * @return void */ public function exit(): void { Auth::logoff(); } Standard login structure To create a predefined login structure, use php vinci auth:skeleton --login This command will create a LoginController class, templates for authentication, dashboard and predefined routes. Plus a standard user in the database. If you want to remove this structure, use php vinci auth:skeleton --login --remove . Authentication using Sodium encryption You can create an authentication using Sodium encryption. Generating a sodium key First, you need to generate a sodium key.

Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously recovered or computed data. How to use - PSR6/PSR-16 PSR-6 To use the PSR-6, you can follow the step by step guide here use Solital\\Core\\Cache\\Psr6\\CachePool; $pool = new CachePool(); $item = $pool->getItem('aaa'); $item->set(123); $pool->commit(); PSR-16 You can cache through PSR-16. To do this, perform the instance of the Cache class as follows: use Solital\\Cache\\SimpleCache; $cache = new SimpleCache(); $list = User::select()->get(); // The 'has' method checks whether the index exists if ($cache->has('list') == true) { echo '<h1>from cache</h1>'; // The 'get' method returns the cached value if it exists $cache->get('list'); } else { echo '<h1>created cache</h1>'; // The 'set' method creates the cached file $cache->set('list', $list, 20); } // Displays the original content of the $list variable echo '<h1>from original</h1>'; var_dump($list); To delete the cache that was created, use the delete method passing the cache key as a parameter. $cache->delete('list'); The has method checks whether the item key exists. If it exists, use the get method to retrieve the generated cache by passing the key value as a parameter. If it does not exist, the set method creates the cached file, passing in the first parameter the name of the key, the value that will be stored and the time (in int ) that this cached file will be valid. The syntax is similar to the single cache. But the getMultiple method needs an array containing the key values as a parameter. The setMultiple method generates the cache if it does not exist, but pass as an parameter an array in which the keys will be the indexes of the array, and in the last parameter spend the time that the cache will be valid. use Solital\\Cache\\SimpleCache; $cache = new SimpleCache(); $list = [ 'nome' => 'Harvey Specter', 'email' => 'specter@pearsonhardman.com' ]; $list2 = [ 'nome' => 'Louis Litt', 'email' => 'liitup@pearsonhardman.com' ]; $cache->getMultiple(['list1', 'list2']); echo '<h1>created cache</h1>'; $cache->setMultiple([ 'list1' => $list, 'list2' => $list2 ], 20); echo '<h1>from original</h1>'; print_r($list); print_r($list2); In the multiple cache, use deleteMultiple by passing an array containing the cache keys to delete the cached files generated with the setMultiple method. $cache->deleteMultiple([\"list1\", \"list2\"]); Clear cache To clear the entire cache created with the Cache class, use the clear function. $cache->clear(); Cache drive Memcache To use the Memcache drive, first make sure you have this drive installed on your machine. To change the Solital cache drive, change the cache.yaml file in the app/config/ folder. # Set cache type cache_drive: memcache # (If memcache is used) Set host and port cache_host: 127.0.0.1 cache_port: 11211 HTTP Cache Font by heroku The modern day developer has a wide variety of techniques and technologies available to improve application performance and end-user experience. One of the most frequently overlooked technologies is that of the HTTP cache. HTTP caching is a universally adopted specification across all modern web browsers, making its implementation in web applications simple. Appropriate use of these standards can benefit your application greatly, improving response times and reducing server load. However, incorrect caching can cause users to see out-of-date content and hard to debug issues. This article discusses the specifics of HTTP caching and in what scenarios to employ an HTTP cache header based strategy. use Solital\\Core\\Http\\HttpCache; $cache = new HttpCache(); Cache-Control The Cache-Control header is the most important header to set as it effectively \u2018switches on\u2019 caching in the browser. With this header in place, and set with a value that enables caching, the browser will cache the file for as long as specified. Without this header the browser will re-request the file on each subsequent request. public resources can be cached not only by the end-user\u2019s browser but also by any intermediate proxies that may be serving many other users as well. private resources are bypassed by intermediate proxies and can only be cached by the end-client. The value of the Cache-Control header is a composite one, indicating whether the resource is public or private while also indicating the maximum amount of time it can be cached before considered stale. The max-age value sets a timespan for how long to cache the resource (in seconds). In the first parameter it is necessary to inform public or private , and in the second parameter the timestamp value of max_age . $cache->cacheControl(\"public\", 31536000); While the Cache-Control header turns on client-side caching and sets the max-age of a resource the Expires header is used to specify a specific point in time the resource is no longer valid. Expires When accompanying the Cache-Control header, Expires simply sets a date from which the cached resource should no longer be considered valid. From this date forward the browser will request a fresh copy of the resource. Until then, the browsers local cached copy will be used: $cache->cacheControl(\"public\", 31536000); $cache->expires(); Time-based A time-based conditional request ensures that only if the requested resource has changed since the browser\u2019s copy was cached will the contents be transferred. If the cached copy is the most up-to-date then the server returns the 304 response code. To enable conditional requests the application specifies the last modified time of a resource via the Last-Modified response header. To use this condition, use the lastModified method after the cacheControl method. $cache->cacheControl(\"public\", 31536000); $cache->lastModified(); The next time the browser requests this resource it will only ask for the contents of the resource if they\u2019re unchanged since this date using the If-Modified-Since request header $cache->ifModifiedSince(); If the resource hasn\u2019t changed, the server will return with an empty body with the 304 response code. Etag The ETag (or Entity Tag) works in a similar way to the Last-Modified header except its value is a digest of the resources contents (for instance, an MD5 hash). This allows the server to identify if the cached contents of the resource are different to the most recent version. Use the eTag class parameter the value that will be cached. $cache->cacheControl(\"public\", 31536000); $cache->eTag('value'); Cache prevention Highly secure or variable resources often require no caching. For instance, anything involving a shopping cart checkout process. Unfortunately, merely omitting cache headers will not work as many modern web browsers cache items based on their own internal algorithms. In such cases it is necessary to tell the browser to explicitly to not cache items. In addition to public and private the Cache-Control header can specify no-cache and no-store which informs the browser to not cache the resources under any circumstances. $cache->noCacheControl(); Clear Solital Cache When using your project several times, it is common for several stored session files to appear. These files are located inside the app/Storage/session folder. If you are using the Wolf cache, then these files can double in size. If you need to, you can use the Vinci Console to clear the general cache, just the session cache, or just the Wolf cache. To clear the general cache, use: php vinci cache:clear If you only want to clear the session cache, use the --session option: php vinci cache:clear --session And to clear the cache of the app/Storage/cache/* folder, use the --cache option: php vinci cache:clear --cache","title":"Cache"},{"location":"cache/#how-to-use-psr6psr-16","text":"PSR-6 To use the PSR-6, you can follow the step by step guide here use Solital\\Core\\Cache\\Psr6\\CachePool; $pool = new CachePool(); $item = $pool->getItem('aaa'); $item->set(123); $pool->commit(); PSR-16 You can cache through PSR-16.

Before injecting a dependency it needs to be instantiated. So, we don't just take care of the \"injection\", we also need to have the knowledge of what objects it needs to work. A dependency injection container (DI Container) manages and automates instantiations. We tell him how an object should be created (this is the part that touches us, our knowledge about it) and then whenever we need it, we just need to use the container to obtain it. Solital implements the PSR-11, meaning you can easily create dependency containers. Consider this example: <?php class UserManager { private $mailer; public function __construct() { $this->mailer = new Mailer(); $this->mailer->setTransport('sendmail'); } public function setMailerTransport($transport) { $this->mailer->setTransport($transport); } } Here we have our UserManager service that is responsible for creating its Mailer dependency via setter injection. If we decide to later change the type of mailer that is used, and that mailer uses constructor injection rather than setter injection, we must alter our UserManager code, potentially breaking other methods that may use the setTransport method. Instead, the UserManager service should simply ask for a Mailer object, and get one. It should not care how it is created or what methods the mailer uses to configure itself, it just asks for one and receives one: class UserManager { private $mailer; public function __construct(Mailer $mailer) { $this->mailer = $mailer; } } The configuration of the mailer is now setup outside of the UserManager , and will not break anything if it is changed. So that leaves us with a question: Where should we write this \"wiring\" or configuration of the dependencies? That's where the container concept comes in. An IoC, or dependency injection container is the place where you would write up how your services should be created. Going back to the above example: <?php use Solital\\Core\\Container\\Container; $container = new Container(); $container->add('userManager', function($container) { $mailer = $container->get('mailer'); return new UserManager($mailer); }); $container->add('mailer', function() { $transport = 'gmail'; $mailer = new Mailer($transport); }); Now all we have to do is ask for the UserManager , and its Mailer dependency will be created for us. If we decide to change the transport methodback to sendmail at any point, all we have to do is change it in one place in the service configuration area. Usage Instantiation To use the container, simply create a new instance of the Container class: $container = new Container(); You may also optionally pass an array of service and parameter entries directly into the constructor: $entries = ['foo' => 'bar']; $container = new Container($entries); Adding Definitions Services are defined by invokable callback functions. Most commonly, this is a closure (anonymous function) that explains how to create a service: $myServiceDefinition = function() { $obj = new Service(); return $obj; }; Parameters are simple primitive values that should be accessed throughout your application. It is assumed that your entry is a parameter if it is not an invokable function. To add a service or parameter to the container, use the Container::add method. $container = new Container(); $container->add('myParameter', 'value'); $container->add('myService', function() { return new MyService(); }); The container can also be accessed like an array. So adding entries is as easy as using array notation: $container = new Container(); $container['myParameter'] = 'value'; $container['myService'] = function() { return new MyService(); }; When defining services, note that an instance of the container is always passed as an argument to the invokable callback. This allows you to resolve nested dependencies. In our synopsis, we used the example of a UserManager service who needed a Mailer object. We can define how to create the mailer in one entry, and how to create the user manager in a separate entry like this: $container = new Container(); $container['userManager'] = function($container) { // The user manager needs a mailer, so get that from the container first $mailer = $container->get('mailer'); // Now pass that to the UserManager return new UserManager($mailer); }; $container['mailer'] = function() { return new Mailer(); }; $userManager = $container->get('userManager'); This is known as manually wiring your dependencies. Entry Management Just as entries can be added to the container, they may be removed via Container::remove as well: $container = new Container(); $container['myParameter'] = 'value'; $container->remove('myParameter'); // or: unset($container['myParameter']); We can also check if the container contains as entry with Container::has : $container = new Container(); $container['myParameter'] = 'value'; $has = $container->has('myParameter'); // or: isset($container['myParameter']); var_dump($has); // outputs: true Lastly, we can get an array of all of the entry names in our container with Container::keys : $container = new Container(); $container['myParameter'] = 'value'; $entries = $container->keys(); var_dump($entries); // outputs: ['myParameter'] Retrieving Services and Parameters Once an entry is added to the container, we can resolve that entry by using the Container::get method, or via array access: $container = new Container(); $container['myParameter'] = 'value'; $myParameter = $container->get('myParameter'); var_dump($myParameter); // outputs: 'value' $container['myService'] = function() { return new MyService(); }; $myService = $container['myService']; var_dump($myService instanceof MyService::class); // outputs: true Note that the service definition is executed and the result of the callback is what is assigned to $myService , rather than the literal callback function. If you would like a callback function to be interpreted as a literal value, you can use the Container::protect method: $container = new Container(); $container->add('myService', $container->protect(function() { return new MyService(); })); $myServiceFactory = $container->get('myService'); var_dump($myServiceFactory instanceof \\Closure); // outputs: true By default, when the container resolves a service entry, that service will be \"shared\" across the life of the container. This means that when the container is asked for the service a second time, the same instance will be returned as the first. This is often times the desired behavior when dealing with database connections, mailers, and logger objects. It would be a waste of memory to create these types of objects multiple times. You would not want 20 different database connections open at the same time if you really only need one: $container = new Container(); $container->add('db', function() { ... // database configuration return new PDO(); }); $db = $container->get('db'); $db2 = $container->get('db'); var_dump($db === $db2); // outputs: true However, sometimes you do need to get a new instance of a service each time it is accessed. For those cases, simply define the service as a factory with Container::factory : $container = new Container(); $container->add('myService', $container->factory(function() { return new MyService(); })); $myService = $container->get('myService'); $myService2 = $container->get('myService'); var_dump($myService === $myService2); // outputs: false Extending Definitions Often times you need to modify a service after it has been created. This is often times called \"setter injection\" or \"decorating\". This can be achieved by using the Container::extend method. The extend method is passed the instance of the object and an instance of the container in that order. An extend will fail if: The entry does not exist The entry is a parameter The entry is currently being resolved The entry is protected The extend callback is not invokable Therefore, extending is meant to be done on existing service definitions only: $container = new Container(); $container['mailer'] = function() { return new Mailer(); }; $container->extend('mailer', function($mailer, $container) { $mailer->setTransport('sendmail'); $mailer->setUsername($container->get(...)); }); If, however, you leave the second argument empty and only assign an invokable callback, like so: $container->extend(function() {}); This will be treated as a global callback function that should be run on every resolve. This is also a cool way to see how inversion of control works. We can assign a callback to run whenever the container resolves any type of entry, and get some feedback about what it is creating. A great example of dependency injection comes from the Auryn container docs: class Car { private $engine; public function __construct(Engine $engine) { $this->engine = $engine; } } class Engine { private $sparkPlug; private $piston; public function __construct(SparkPlug $sparkPlug, Piston $piston) { $this->sparkPlug = $sparkPlug; $this->piston = $piston; } } As you can see we have a Car object that depends on an Engine object, and the Engine object depends on its own service objects SparkPlug and Piston . Using a normal object creation workflow, the wiring of these objects would look something like this: Application needs Car Car needs Engine so: Engine needs SparkPlug and Piston so: Engine creates SparkPlug Engine creates Piston Car creates engine Application creates Car However the wiring of objects using inversion of control looks like this: Application needs Car, which needs Engine, which needs SparkPlug and Piston so: Application creates SparkPlug and Piston Application creates Engine and gives it SparkPlug and Piston Application creates Car and gives it Engine You can see that the difference with inversion of control is that application (container) creates the dependencies in an inverted fashion, creating the lowest level dependencies first, and passing them up through the chain of services. This ensures that none of the services know how their dependencies are created, and that they are loosely coupled. We can have a look at this in action with something like this: $container = new Container(); // Create something to run on every resolve $container->extend(function($resolved, $container) { echo is_object($resolved) ? get_class($resolved) . ' created.<br />' : ''; }); // Define our services $container['sparkPlug'] = function() { return new SparkPlug(); }; $container['piston'] = function() { return new Piston(); }; $container['engine'] = function($c) { return new Engine($c['sparkPlug'], $c['piston']); }; $container['car'] = function($c) { return new Car($c['engine']); }; // Get our service $container->get('car'); This would then output the following: SparkPlug created. Piston created. Engine created. Car created. This is proof that the container uses the inversion of control principle since the global callback function gets called after each resolve. Service Providers Service providers are a way to organize your container entries. Service providers are nothing more than classes that implement the ServiceProvider interface that exposes a register method. The register method is always passed an instance of the container. For example, lets say that you have a suite of services that deal with user management. You could organize them into a single service provider class/file called UserServiceProvider . This class would then be responsible for adding all container entries related to user management. This simply provides a more organized and collected way of registering data in the container: class UserServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider { public function register(ContainerInterface $container) { $container->add('userManager', function() { ... }); $container->add('foo' ...); ... } }","title":"Dependency Container"},{"location":"dependency-container/#introduction","text":"Injecting dependencies can become a tedious task when many classes are involved.

' created.<br />' : ''; }); // Define our services $container['sparkPlug'] = function() { return new SparkPlug(); }; $container['piston'] = function() { return new Piston(); }; $container['engine'] = function($c) { return new Engine($c['sparkPlug'], $c['piston']); }; $container['car'] = function($c) { return new Car($c['engine']); }; // Get our service $container->get('car'); This would then output the following: SparkPlug created. Piston created. Engine created. Car created. This is proof that the container uses the inversion of control principle since the global callback function gets called after each resolve.","title":"Extending Definitions"},{"location":"dependency-container/#service-providers","text":"Service providers are a way to organize your container entries. Service providers are nothing more than classes that implement the ServiceProvider interface that exposes a register method. The register method is always passed an instance of the container. For example, lets say that you have a suite of services that deal with user management. You could organize them into a single service provider class/file called UserServiceProvider . This class would then be responsible for adding all container entries related to user management. This simply provides a more organized and collected way of registering data in the container: class UserServiceProvider implements ServiceProvider { public function register(ContainerInterface $container) { $container->add('userManager', function() { ... }); $container->add('foo' ...); ... } }","title":"Service Providers"},{"location":"deploy/","text":"To deploy your project made in Solital Framework, do a git pull on your hosting.

The event loop is responsible for monitoring external resources for interesting events such as new input data or state changes. Once an event is detected, the event loop will resume the fibers that are interested in that event so they can process it. There are many ways to implement such a loop, ranging from a trivial sleep and resume to a complex, multifeatured event monitoring system. In this article, we'll look at a few examples and build up on the complexity as we go. Below is an example of how to use EventLoop in your project: use Solital\\Core\\Queue\\EventLoop; $loop = new EventLoop(); $loop->defer(function() use ($loop){ $loop->sleep(0.2); foreach (range(1, 5) as $value) { echo $value; $loop->next(); } }); $loop->defer(function() use ($loop){ foreach (range(1, 10) as $value) { echo $value; $loop->next(); } }); $loop->run();","title":"Event Loop"},{"location":"events/","text":"Events This section will help you understand how to register your own callbacks to events in the router.

On this object you can add as many callbacks as you like by calling the registerEvent method. When you've registered events, make sure to add it to the router by calling Course::addEventHandler() . We recommend that you add your event-handlers within your routes.php . Example: use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Handlers\\EventHandler; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Event\\EventArgument; // --- your routes goes here --- $eventHandler = new EventHandler(); // Add event that fires when a route is rendered $eventHandler->register(EventHandler::EVENT_RENDER_ROUTE, function(EventArgument $argument) { // Get the route by using the special argument for this event. $route = $argument->route; // DO STUFF... }); Course::addEventHandler($eventHandler); Custom EventHandlers EventHandler is the class that manages events and must inherit from the EventHandlerInterface interface. The handler knows how to handle events for the given handler-type. Most of the time the basic \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Handler\\EventHandler class will be more than enough for most people as you simply register an event which fires when triggered. Let's go over how to create your very own event-handler class. Below is a basic example of a custom event-handler called DatabaseDebugHandler . The idea of the sample below is to logs all events to the database when triggered. Hopefully it will be enough to give you an idea on how the event-handlers work. namespace Demo\\Handlers; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Event\\EventArgument; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router; class DatabaseDebugHandler implements EventHandlerInterface { /** * Debug callback * @var \\Closure */ protected $callback; public function __construct() { $this->callback = function (EventArgument $argument) { // todo: store log in database }; } /** * Get events. * * @param string|null $name Filter events by name. * @return array */ public function getEvents(?string $name): array { return [ $name => [ $this->callback, ], ]; } /** * Fires any events registered with given event-name * * @param Router $router Router instance * @param string $name Event name * @param array ...$eventArgs Event arguments */ public function fireEvents(Router $router, string $name, ...$eventArgs): void { $callback = $this->callback; $callback(new EventArgument($router, $eventArgs)); } /** * Set debug callback * * @param \\Closure $event */ public function setCallback(\\Closure $event): void { $this->callback = $event; } } Using the PSR-14 It is possible to use the PSR-14 through the EventDispatcher class. You can create the test class below: class UserTest { public function testLow() { echo \"Running Low ...\"; } public function testNormal() { echo \"Running Normal ...\"; } public function testHigh() { echo \"Running High ...\"; } } Then, use the addListener method to add the event referring to the UserTest class.

You can change these settings using the $table and $id variables. <?php namespace Solital\\Components\\Model; use Katrina\\Katrina; class User extends Katrina { /** * @var null|string */ protected ?string $table = \"tb_user\"; /** * @var null|string */ protected ?string $id = \"id_user\"; /** * @var null|bool */ protected bool $timestamp = false; } SELECT To list all fields in the table, use all() as shown in the previous example. User::all(); To list a single value, use find() method; User::find(2); Or, use the select method: /** * Fetch all */ User::select()->get(); /** * Fetch only */ User::select()->where('id', 2)->getUnique(); /** * Fetch all with column name */ User::select(\"name\")->get(); You can return the latest values from the database in descending order using the latest method: User::latest()->get(); By default, the latest method will sort using the created_at column. If this column does not exist in your table, you can pass the noe of another column as a parameter. User::latest('users')->get(); WHERE If you need the WHERE clause, use where() method. /** * Katrina will look for a record that has `foo` in the table. */ User::select()->where(\"name\", \"foo\")->get(); /** * Katrina will look for a record whose age is greater than 10. */ User::select()->where(\"age\", 10, \">\")->get(); /** * Katrina will look for a record that is under the age of 10. */ User::select()->where(\"age\", 10, \"<\")->get(); AND/OR If there are more conditions for the where method, you can make use of the and/or methods: /** * With AND clause */ User::select()->where(\"brand\", 'visa')->and(\"cvv\", '502')->get(); /** * With OR clause */ User::select()->where(\"brand\", 'visa')->or(\"cvv\", '502')->get(); Multiple WHERE To save time and avoid using the and method, you can pass an array as a parameter in the where method with multiple conditions. User::select()->where([ 'brand', 'visa', 'cvv', '502' ])->get(); LIKE and BETWEEN You can combine the where method with other search methods such as like and between . /** * With LIKE clause */ User::select()->where(\"name\")->like(\"%foo%\")->get(); /** * With BETWEEN clause */ User::select()->where(\"age\")->between(10, 22)->get(); LIMIT User::select()->limit(0, 3)->get(); ORDER BY User::select()->order(\"name\")->get(); By default, the result will always return ascending. To return values descending, use false in the second parameter. User::select()->order(\"name\", false)->get(); GROUP BY The group by SQL command requires the use of a function. Use the group() method together with the Functions class (see here ). User::select(null, \"name, \" . Functions::count('*', 'qtd'))->group(\"name\")->get(); Using INNER JOIN The innerJoin() method returns the values of two tables that have a foreign key. The first parameter represents the table containing the foreign key. The second parameter represents the id of the foreign key. User::select() ->innerJoin(\"table1\", \"id1\") ->innerJoin(\"table2\", \"id2\") ->get(); If you need to use the WHERE clause, use the where() method. User::select() ->innerJoin(\"table1\", \"id1\") ->innerJoin(\"table2\", \"id2\") ->where(\"phone\", 123123123) ->get(); NOTE: If you have two or more tables where the column names are the same, remember to specify the table names in the where() method: User::select() ->innerJoin(\"table1\", \"id1\") ->innerJoin(\"table2\", \"id2\") ->where(\"table1.phone\", 123123123) ->get(); Custom SELECT You can create a custom SELECT statement. To do this, use the function customQuery . /** * Fetch Only */ User::customQuery(\"SELECT * FROM users\"); /** * Fetch All */ User::customQuery(\"SELECT * FROM users\", true); SELECT inside SELECT Some SQL queries need to have multiple SELECTs, and sometimes those SELECTs are inside other SELECTs. If you need such a query, follow the example: $sql = ORMTest::select(null, \"nome\")->where(\"nome\", \"brenno\")->rawQuery(); $result = ORMTest::select(null, \"nome, idade\")->where(\"nome\", Functions::subquery($sql))->get(); var_dump($result); The rawQuery() function will return an SQL string (you can use a var_dump() to parse the returned string). Then, to use that SQL string inside another query, use the subquery() function. Functions Katrina 2 supports SQL functions. You can use a function in an SQL query using the Function Method: use Katrina\\Functions\\Functions; User::select(null, \"name, \" . Functions::count('*', 'qtd'))->group(\"name\")->get(); Below is a list of all the functions present in Katrina ORM: Aggregate Functions Date Functions Math Functions avg($value) now() abs($value) count($expression = \"*\", $as = \"\") curdate() sum($value) max($value) date($value) truncate($number, $decimal_places) - hour($value) - - month($value) - - datediff($first_date, $second_date) - - day($date = null) - - currentTimestamp() - INSERT Katrina uses the ActiveRecord standard to insert and update database data. However, if you don't want to use the ActiveRecord pattern, you can use the insert() and update() methods. With ActiveRecord To insert data in the table, you must use the column name as a value. If your table has name , age and email columns, then the values should be used following that same sequence. Note the code below: $user = new User(); $user->name = \"Harvey Specter\"; $user->age = 40; $user->email = \"harvey@pearsonspecterlitt.com\"; $user->save(); With the insert method To save data, you must pass an array in which the keys will be the columns of the table. The values of these keys will be inserted into the database. User::insert([ 'name' => 'Harvey Specter', 'age' => 40, 'email' => 'harvey@pearsonspecterlitt.com' ]); If you want to retrieve the last ID entered, use the lastId() method. $res = User::insert([ 'name' => 'Harvey Specter', 'age' => 40, 'email' => 'harvey@pearsonspecterlitt.com' ])->lastId(); var_dump($res); UPDATE With ActiveRecord The process for updating a record in the table is very similar to inserting a record. However, you need to specify the id of your table: $user = new User(); $user->id = 1; $user->name = \"Harvey Specter\"; $user->age = 42; $user->email = \"harvey@specterlitt.com\"; $user->save(); With the update method The process for updating a value in the database using the update method is similar to using the insert method. The difference is that you will use the where method to define the values that will be updated. And to save those changes, the saveUpdate method must be present. User::update([ 'name' => 'Harvey Specter', 'age' => 42, 'email' => 'harvey@specterlitt.com' ])->where('id', 1)->saveUpdate(); Delete To delete a record from the table, use the delete() method. User::delete('id', 2); If you want to delete a row that has a foreign key in another table, the $safe_mode parameter must be changed to false : User::delete('id', 2, false); Manipulating tables Create a new table The createTable() method starts opening the table. After inserting the fields and data types that the tables will have, use closeTable() to close the table. For a better understanding see the syntax below. User::createTable(\"your_table_name\") /* Fields and table type */ ->int(\"id_user\")->primary()->increment() ->varchar(\"name\", 20)->unique()->notNull()->default(\"specter\") ->int(\"age\", 3)->unsigned()->notNull() ->varchar(\"email\", 30)->default(\"harvey.specter@gmail.com\")->notNull() ->varchar(\"profession\", 40) ->constraint(\"dev_cons_fk\")->foreign(\"type\")->references(\"dev\", \"iddev\") /* Close the command to create the table */ ->closeTable(); For POSTGRESQL Postgresql doesn't natively support the AUTO_INCREMENT command. An alternative is to use the SERIAL command. So, if you are going to create a table using Postgresql as a database, use the serial() method. User::createTable(\"your_table_name\") ->serial('id_user')->primary() # ... List tables To have a list of all the tables in your database, use the listTables() method. User::listTables(); List columns To list the columns of a table, use the describeTable() method passing as a parameter the name of your table. User::describeTable('your_table'); Alter table The alter() method performs the procedures of adding, changing and deleting a field from the database table. Add new field Use add() method together with the data type to add a new field. (new User)->alter(\"your_table\")->varchar(\"username\", 20)->add(); Drop column Use the drop() method to delete a column from the table. (new User)->alter(\"your_table\")->drop(\"username\"); Modify column Use the modify SQL with the modify() method. (new User)->alter(\"your_table\")->varchar(\"name\", 100)->modify(); Rename table Use the rename() method to rename a database table. (new User)->alter(\"your_table_name\")->rename(\"new_table_name\"); Adding foreign key To add a foreign key to an already created table, use the constraint() method to add a constraint; foreign() to inform the column and references() to refer to the table. (new User)->alter(\"your_table\")->constraint(\"dev_cons_fk\")->foreign(\"type\")->references(\"dev\", \"iddev\"); Truncate table To use the sql truncate command, use the truncate() method. (new User)->truncate(\"your_table\"); By default, the database checks the table's foreign key and locks the truncate command. To disable foreign key verification, enter true as a parameter. (new User)->truncate(\"your_table\", true); Procedure To call a database procedure, use the call() method. (new User)->call('procedure_name'); To use procedure parameters, pass the values in array format. (new User)->call('procedure_name' , ['param_1, param_2, param_3']); Transactions Transactions are typically implemented by \"saving-up\" your batch of changes to be applied all at once; this has the nice side effect of drastically improving the efficiency of those updates. In other words, transactions can make your scripts faster and potentially more robust (you still need to use them correctly to reap that benefit). try { $pdo = Connection::getInstance(); $pdo->beginTransaction(); // code... $pdo->commit(); } catch (\\PDOException $e) { $pdo->rollback(); echo $e->getMessage(); } Pagination The pagination() method creates a system for paging results. To initialize, the first parameter must be the table you want to use to start paging. The second parameter will list the amount of values that will be returned from the table as shown in the example below. $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3); To retrieve the table values from the database, you can use the getRows() method. And to use pagination, use the getArrows() method. /** Returns table data */ $values->getRows(); /** Returns commands to advance or return */ $values->getArrows() To use pagination with relationship in another table, in the third parameter pass an array containing the name of the table that has a relationship with the current table, the column name of the current table that has the foreign key and the column name of the primary key of the another table. $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3, ['foreign_table', 'column_foreign_key', 'column_primary_key']); INNER JOIN If you want to use pagination with a table that has a foreign key, pass an array in the third parameter. In the first index, insert the name of the table that is linked to the current table, in the second index the name of the column that contains the foreign key and in the third index the column name of the primary key of the table that references the current table $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3, ['foreign_table', 'column_foreign_key', 'column_primary_key'], \"status=true\"); WHERE clause To use the WHERE clause, use the fourth parameter as shown below. $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3, null, \"status=true\"); Transactions Wolf Template Data pagination is widely used in project templates. You can integrate pagination into Wolf Template as follows: $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3); return view('home', [ 'values' => $values ]); In your template, retrieve the data like this: <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Age</th> <th>Gender</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> {% foreach ($values->getRows() as $result): %} <tr> <td>{{ $result['name'] }}</td> <td>{{ $result['age'] }}</td> <td>{{ $result['gender'] }}</td> </tr> {% endforeach; %} </tbody> </table> {{ $values->getArrows(); }} The result will be as follows: Name Age Gender Sam 47 Male Dean 49 Male Marry 52 Female << 1 2 3 >> To change the arrows ( << and >> ), use the parameters of the getArrows() method. The result will be: {{ $values->getArrows('First', 'Last'); }} Name Age Gender Sam 47 Male Dean 49 Male Marry 52 Female First 2 3 Last Custom Pagination The pagination() method uses a basic SELECT statement. If you need to use a much more complex SELECT, consider using the customPagination() method. $values = (new User)->customPagination(\"SELECT created_at, order_status, idSession, SUM(idOrder) AS idOrder FROM `tb_order` GROUP BY created_at, order_status, idSession\", 3); Customizing arrows CSS You can customize the look of the arrows through the classes pagination_first_item , pagination_atual_item , pagination_others_itens and pagination_last_item . Below is a customization to serve as an example: .pagination_atual_item { background-color: #B5B5B5; padding: 10px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 30px; transition: 0.2s; } .pagination_first_item, .pagination_others_itens, .pagination_last_item { background-color: #4682B4; color: #FFF; padding: 10px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 30px; transition: 0.2s; text-decoration: none; } .pagination_first_item:hover, .pagination_others_itens:hover, .pagination_last_item:hover { background-color: #0071E3; color: #FFF !important; transition: 0.2s; } Types of data Below is listed the attributes and data supported by Katrina ORM: String data Numerical data Date and time varchar(\"column_name\", size) tinyint(\"column_name\", size) date(\"column_name\") char(\"column_name\", size) smallint(\"column_name\", size) year(\"column_name\") tinytext(\"column_name\", size) mediumint(\"column_name\", size) time(\"column_name\") mediumtext(\"column_name\", size) bigint(\"column_name\", size) datetime(\"column_name\") longtext(\"column_name\", size) int(\"column_name\", size) timestamp(\"column_name\") text(\"column_name\") decimal(\"column_name\", value1, value2) - Attributes Boolean boolean(\"column_name\") default(\"default_value\") unique() - unsigned() - incremet() (MYSQL) - notNull() - primary() - after(\"column_name\") - first() - serial(\"id_table\") (POSTGRESQL) -","title":"Katrina ORM"},{"location":"katrina-orm/#version","text":"Katrina ORM is currently at version 2.x .

You can integrate pagination into Wolf Template as follows: $values = (new User)->pagination('your_table', 3); return view('home', [ 'values' => $values ]); In your template, retrieve the data like this: <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Age</th> <th>Gender</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> {% foreach ($values->getRows() as $result): %} <tr> <td>{{ $result['name'] }}</td> <td>{{ $result['age'] }}</td> <td>{{ $result['gender'] }}</td> </tr> {% endforeach; %} </tbody> </table> {{ $values->getArrows(); }} The result will be as follows: Name Age Gender Sam 47 Male Dean 49 Male Marry 52 Female << 1 2 3 >> To change the arrows ( << and >> ), use the parameters of the getArrows() method.

It helps when carrying out common routines, such as the famous CRUD (create, read, edit and delete), in addition to having a login and data paging system. Requirements PHP >= 7.2 (Compatible with PHP 8) PHP PDO extension enabled Installation Katrina ORM is already installed by default in Solital. But if you are going to install in another project, use the command below to download via Composer. composer require solital/katrina Settings In Solital: # DATABASE CONFIG DB_DRIVE=\"your_drive\" DB_HOST=\"your_host\" DB_NAME=\"your_database_name\" DB_USER=\"your_user\" DB_PASS=\"your_password\" In another project: define('DB_CONFIG', [ 'DRIVE' => 'your_drive', 'HOST' => 'your_host', 'DBNAME' => 'your_database_name', 'USER' => 'your_user', 'PASS' => 'your_password' ]); For SQLite Some differences exist for connecting to an SQLite database. First, add an additional index called SQLITE_DIR in the DB_CONFIG constant. This constant must have the absolute path where the SQLite database file will be located. Then, assign the value sqlite in the index DRIVE . define('DB_CONFIG', [ 'DRIVE' => 'sqlite', 'DBNAME' => 'your_database_name.db', 'SQLITE_DIR' => '/path/to/file/' ]); In Solital: # DATABASE CONFIG DB_DRIVE=\"your_drive\" DB_HOST=\"your_host\" DB_NAME=\"your_database_name\" DB_USER=\"your_user\" DB_PASS=\"your_password\" SQLITE_DIR=\"/path/to/file/\" Initial structure You can use katrina in two ways: 1\u00b0) In Solital, extend the model already created and define the variables $table , $primaryKey and $columns in your model's constructor as listed below: <?php namespace Solital\\Components\\Model; use Solital\\Components\\Model\\Model; class User extends Model { public function __construct() { $this->table = 'your_database_table'; $this->primaryKey = 'primary_key_of_the_table'; $this->columns = [ 'first_column_of_the_table', 'second column of the table', #... ]; } public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->build(\"ALL\"); } } 2\u00b0) Or if you are using it in another project <?php use Katrina\\Katrina as Katrina; class User { # String private $table = 'your_database_table'; # String private $primaryKey = 'primary_key_of_the_table'; # Array private $columns = [ 'first_column_of_the_table', 'second column of the table', #... ]; public function instance() { $katrina = new Katrina($this->table, $this->columnPrimaryKey, $this->columns); return $katrina; } public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->build(\"ALL\"); } } Data manipulation - CRUD List To list all fields in the table, use select() as shown in the previous example. By default, the method will list all fields in the table. public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->build(\"ALL\"); } To list a single value, pass the table field id as a parameter, and in build() method use ONLY . public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(3)->build(\"ONLY\"); } To specify which fields you want to list, pass the values \u200b\u200bas parameters. public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(null, null, \"name, city, country\")->build(\"ALL\"); } WHERE If you need the WHERE clause, use the second parameter. public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(null, 'name=\"Clark\"', \"name, city, country\") ->build(\"ALL\"); } With primary key: public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(3, 'name=\"Clark\"', \"name, city, country\") ->build(\"ONLY\"); } LIMIT public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->limit(2, 5)->build(\"ALL\"); } LIKE The LIKE operator must always be used with the WHERE . public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(null, \"name\")->like(\"%Harvey%\")->build(\"ALL\"); } ORDER BY public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->order(\"name\")->build(\"ALL\"); } By default, the result will always return ascending. To return values descending, use false in the second parameter. public function get() { return $this->instance()->select()->order(\"name\", false)->build(\"ALL\"); } BETWEEN The BETWEEN operator must always be used with the WHERE . public function get() { return $this->instance()->select(null, \"age\")->between(18, 25)->build(\"ALL\"); } Listing foreign key The innerJoin() method returns the values of two tables that have a foreign key. The first parameter will be the name of the table that has a relationship with the current table. The second will be an array containing in the first index the column name of the current table that has the foreign key, and in the second index the column name of the primary key of the other table. To make it easier, see an example below. public function get() { return $this->instance()->innerJoin(\"address\", [\"idForeignAddress\", \"idAddress\"]) ->build(\"ALL\"); } If you need to use the WHERE clause, pass the command in the third parameter as shown below. public function get() { return $this->instance()->innerJoin(\"address\", [\"idForeignAddress\", \"idAddress\"], \"order_status=true\")->build(\"ALL\"); } You can inform which fields you want to return. \"a\" is your main table while \"b\" is your table that has the foreign key. public function get() { return $this->instance()->innerJoin(\"address\", [\"idForeignAddress\", \"idAddress\"], \"order_status=true\", \"a.idPerson, a.name, b.street\", \"address\", \"idAddress\")->build(\"ALL\"); } Custom SELECT You can create a custom SELECT statement. To do this, use the function customQueryOnly to return a single value from the database, and customQueryAll to return all values from the database. public function getAll() { return $this->instance()->customQueryAll(\"SELECT a.idSession, SUM(b.price) AS price, SUM(a.qtd) AS qtd FROM tb_order a INNER JOIN tb_product b WHERE MONTH( a.created_at) = MONTH(NOW()) GROUP BY a.idSession\"); } public function getOnly() { return $this->instance()->customQueryOnly(\"SELECT a.idSession, SUM(b.price) AS price, SUM(a.qtd) AS qtd FROM tb_order a INNER JOIN tb_product b WHERE MONTH( a.created_at) = MONTH(NOW()) GROUP BY a.idSession\"); } Insert The insert() method inserts the values \u200b\u200binto the table. It is NOT necessary to use build() method to insert the data. To do this, create an array with the values \u200b\u200bthat the method will receive /** * Return bool */ public function insert() { $res = $this->instance()->insert(['Clark', 'Metropolis', 'EUA']); return $res; } To return the last insert ID, pass a true in the second parameter. /** * Return array * * ['res'] => 'true', * ['lastId'] => '2' */ public function insert() { $res = $this->instance()->insert(['Clark', 'Metropolis', 'EUA'], true); return $res; } Update The update() method updates the values \u200b\u200bin the table. It is NOT necessary to use build() method to update the data. The process is similar to the insert method. The first parameter is the columns that will be updated, the second parameter the values \u200b\u200band the third the row id . You can use an integer or a string in the third parameter public function update() { $res = $this->instance()->update(['name', 'age'], ['Specter', '41'], \"id=3\"); return $res; } Or public function update() { $res = $this->instance()->update(['name', 'age'], ['Specter', '41'], 3); return $res; } Delete The delete() method deletes the values \u200b\u200bin the table. Enter the value of the line to be deleted, the value being the primary key. public function delete() { $res = $this->instance()->delete(3)->build(); return $res; } Or a string public function delete() { $res = $this->instance()->delete(\"Bruce\")->build(); return $res; } By default, the delete method uses the column name of the primary key to delete the row, but you can use the name of another column using the second parameter. public function delete() { $res = $this->instance()->delete(\"Bruce\", \"name\")->build(); return $res; } ** Force delete with foreign key ** In some cases there may be a need to delete a record with the foreign key from another table. To disable foreign key checking, you can use the third parameter as true . public function delete() { $res = $this->instance()->delete(3, null, true)->build(); return $res; } Manipulating tables Create a new table The createTable() method starts opening the table. After inserting the fields and data types that the tables will have, use closeTable() to close the table. For a better understanding see the syntax below. $res = $this->instance() /* Starts the table by specifying its name */ ->createTable(\"your_table_name\") /* Fields and table type */ ->int(\"id_orm\")->primary()->increment() ->varchar(\"name\", 20)->unique()->notNull()->default(\"specter\") ->int(\"age\", 3)->unsigned()->notNull() ->varchar(\"email\", 30)->default(\"harvey.specter@gmail.com\")->notNull() ->varchar(\"profession\", 40) ->int(\"tipo\") ->constraint(\"dev_cons_fk\")->foreign(\"type\")->references(\"dev\", \"iddev\") /* Close the command to create the table */ ->closeTable() /* Compile the code above */ ->build(); List tables To have a list of all the tables in your database, use the listTables() method by passing ALL in the build() method. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->listTables()->build(\"ALL\"); return $res; } List columns To list the columns of a table, use the describeTable() method passing as a parameter the name of your table together with ALL in the build() public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->describeTable(\"your_table\")->build(\"ALL\"); return $res; } Alter table The alter() method performs the procedures of adding, changing and deleting a field from the database table. Add new field Use add() method together with the data type to add a new field. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->alter(\"message\")->add() ->varchar(\"first_field\", 10) ->build(); } Drop column Use the drop() method to delete a column from the table. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->alter(\"message\")->drop(\"type\") ->build(); } Modify column Use the modify SQL with the modify() method. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->alter(\"message\")->modify() ->varchar(\"person_type\", 100) ->build(); } Change column Use the change() method to change a column. As a parameter, pass the current column name. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->alter(\"message\")->change(\"person_type\") ->varchar(\"type\", 100) ->build(); } Rename table Use the rename() method to rename a database table. Use the first parameter the current table name and the second parameter the new table name. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->rename(\"message\", \"new_message\") ->build(); } Adding foreign key To add a foreign key to an already created table, use the addConstraint() method to add a constraint; foreign() to inform the column and references() to refer to the table. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->alter(\"message\")->addConstraint(\"dev_cons_fk\")->foreign(\"type\")->references(\"dev\", \"iddev\") ->build(); } NOTE: if you are creating a new table, use the constraint() method instead of addConstraint() as shown below: #... ->constraint(\"dev_cons_fk\")->foreign(\"type\")->references(\"dev\", \"iddev\") #... Drop table To delete a table from the database, use the dropTable() method. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->dropTable(\"message\") ->build(); } Truncate table To use the sql truncate command, use the truncate() method. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->truncate() ->build(); } By default, the database checks the table's foreign key and locks the truncate command. To disable foreign key verification, enter true as a parameter. public function get() { $res = $this->instance() ->truncate(true) ->build(); } Procedure To call a database procedure, use the call() method. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->call('procedure_name'); return $res; } To use procedure parameters, pass the values in array format. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->call('procedure_name' , ['param_1, param_2, param_3']); return $res; } Pagination The pagination() method creates a system for paging results. To initialize, the first parameter must be the table you want to use to start paging. The second parameter will list the amount of values that will be returned from the table as shown in the example below. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->pagination('your_table', 3); return $res; } The above method will return an array containing rows indexes that will return values, and arrows that will return commands for pagination. To use pagination with relationship in another table, in the third parameter pass an array containing the name of the table that has a relationship with the current table, the column name of the current table that has the foreign key and the column name of the primary key of the another table. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->pagination('your_table', 3, ['foreign_table', 'column_foreign_key', 'column_primary_key']); return $res; } INNER JOIN If you want to use pagination with a table that has a foreign key, pass an array in the third parameter. In the first index, insert the name of the table that is linked to the current table, in the second index the name of the column that contains the foreign key and in the third index the column name of the primary key of the table that references the current table public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->pagination('your_table', 3, ['foreign_table', 'column_foreign_key', 'column_primary_key'], \"status=true\"); return $res; } WHERE clause To use the WHERE clause, use the fourth parameter as shown below. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->pagination('your_table', 3, null, \"status=true\"); return $res; } Wolf Templte To use in the Wolf template, use it this way. $html = $this->instance()->pagination('your_table', 3); Wolf::loadView('home', [ 'rows' => $html['rows'], 'arrows' => $html['arrows'] ]); And in your view, return the results that way. <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Age</th> <th>Gender</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <?php foreach ($rows as $r): ?> <tr> <td><?= $r['name'] ?></td> <td><?= $r['age'] ?></td> <td><?= $r['gender'] ?></td> </tr> <?php endforeach; ?> </tbody> </table> <?php echo $arrows; The result will be as follows: Name Age Gender Sam 47 Male Dean 49 Male Marry 52 Female << 1 2 3 >> To change the arrows ( << and >> ), use the last two parameters of the pagination() method.

This method already has a LIMIT by default, in addition to being able to change the name of the arrows. public function get() { $res = $this->instance()->customPagination(\"SELECT created_at, order_status, idSession, SUM(idOrder) AS idOrder FROM `tb_order` GROUP BY created_at, order_status, idSession\", 3, \"First\", \"Last\"); return $res; } Customizing arrows CSS You can customize the look of the arrows through the classes pagination_first_item , pagination_atual_item , pagination_others_itens and pagination_last_item . Below is a customization to serve as an example: .pagination_atual_item { background-color: #B5B5B5; padding: 10px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 30px; transition: 0.2s; } .pagination_first_item, .pagination_others_itens, .pagination_last_item { background-color: #4682B4; color: #FFF; padding: 10px; margin: 5px; border-radius: 5px; margin-top: 30px; transition: 0.2s; } .pagination_first_item:hover, .pagination_others_itens:hover, .pagination_last_item:hover { background-color: #0071E3; color: #FFF !important; transition: 0.2s; } Types of data Below is listed the attributes and data supported by Katrina ORM: String data Types varchar(\"column_name\", size) char(\"column_name\", size) tinytext(\"column_name\", size) mediumtext(\"column_name\", size) longtext(\"column_name\", size) text(\"column_name\") Numerical data Types tinyint(\"column_name\", size) smallint(\"column_name\", size) mediumint(\"column_name\", size) bigint(\"column_name\", size) int(\"column_name\", size) decimal(\"column_name\", value1, value2) Date and time Types date(\"column_name\") year(\"column_name\") time(\"column_name\") datetime(\"column_name\") timestamp(\"column_name\") Boolean Types boolean(\"column_name\") Attributes Types default(\"default_value\") unique() unsigned() incremet() notNull() primary() after(\"column_name\") first()","title":"Katrina1"},{"location":"katrina1/#getting-started","text":"Katrina ORM is a component to bring the object-oriented application development paradigm closer to the relational database paradigm.

Another important concept in the use of logs is the level of the log record, not all information has the same \u201cimportance\u201d in the log, or the same urgency to be dealt with, so entries in a log are categorized by levels: DEBUG: Debug information. INFO: Interesting events. For example: a user performed SQL login or logs. NOTICE: Normal but significant events. WARNING: Exceptional occurrences, but not errors. For example: Use of deprecated APIs, inappropriate use of an API. In general things that are not wrong but need attention. ERROR: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action, but must be logged and monitored. CRITICAL: Critical conditions. For example: An application component is not available, an unexpected exception has occurred. ALERT: Immediate action must be taken. Example: System crashed, database is unavailable, etc. It should trigger an alert for the person in charge to take action as soon as possible. EMERGENCY: Emergency: The system is unusable.

First parameter is the url which the route should match - next parameter is a Closure or callback function that will be triggered once the route matches. Course::get('/', function() { return 'Hello world'; }); Available methods Here you can see a list over all available routes: Course::get($url, $callback, $settings); Course::post($url, $callback, $settings); Course::put($url, $callback, $settings); Course::patch($url, $callback, $settings); Course::delete($url, $callback, $settings); Course::options($url, $callback, $settings); Multiple HTTP-verbs Sometimes you might need to create a route that accepts multiple HTTP-verbs. If you need to match all HTTP-verbs you can use the any method. Course::match(['get', 'post'], '/', function() { // ... }); Course::any('foo', function() { // ... }); We've created a simple method which matches GET and POST which is most commonly used: Course::form('foo', function() { // ... }); Default Base Path This will allows users to set a default basepath for all url requests, which will be prepended to all url parameters. Course::setDefaultBasepath('/forum') Route parameters Required parameters You'll properly wondering by know how you parse parameters from your urls. For example, you might want to capture the users id from an url. You can do so by defining route-parameters. Course::get('/user/{id}', function ($userId) { return 'User with id: ' . $userId; }); You may define as many route parameters as required by your route: Course::get('/posts/{post}/comments/{comment}', function ($postId, $commentId) { // ... }); Note: Route parameters are always encased within {} braces and should consist of alphabetic characters. Route parameters may not contain a - character. Use an underscore _ instead. Optional parameters Occasionally you may need to specify a route parameter, but make the presence of that route parameter optional. You may do so by placing a ? mark after the parameter name. Make sure to give the route's corresponding variable a default value: Course::get('/user/{name?}', function ($name = null) { return $name; }); Course::get('/user/{name?}', function ($name = 'Simon') { return $name; }); Regular expression constraints You may constrain the format of your route parameters using the where method on a route instance. The where method accepts the name of the parameter and a regular expression defining how the parameter should be constrained: Course::get('/user/{name}', function ($name) { // ... do stuff })->where('name', '[A-Za-z]+'); Course::get('/user/{id}', function ($id) { // ... do stuff })->where('id', '[0-9]+'); Course::get('/user/{id}/{name}', function ($id, $name) { // ... do stuff })->where(['id' => '[0-9]+', 'name' => '[a-z]+']); Regular expression route-match You can define a regular-expression match for the entire route if you wish. This is useful if you for example are creating a model-box which loads urls from ajax. The example below is using the following regular expression: /ajax/([\\w]+)/?([0-9]+)?/? which basically just matches /ajax/ and exspects the next parameter to be a string - and the next to be a number (but optional). Matches: /ajax/abc/ , /ajax/abc/123/ Won't match: /ajax/ Match groups specified in the regex will be passed on as parameters: Course::all('/ajax/abc/123', function($param1, $param2) { // param1 = abc // param2 = 123 })->setMatch('/\\/ajax\\/([\\w]+)\\/?([0-9]+)?\\/?/is'); Custom regex for matching parameters By default Solital uses the \\w regular expression when matching parameters. This decision was made with speed and reliability in mind, as this match will match both letters, number and most of the used symbols on the internet. However, sometimes it can be necessary to add a custom regular expression to match more advanced characters like - etc. Instead of adding a custom regular expression to all your parameters, you can simply add a global regular expression which will be used on all the parameters on the route. Note: If you the regular expression to be available across, we recommend using the global parameter on a group as demonstrated in the examples below. Example This example will ensure that all parameters use the [\\w\\-]+ regular expression when parsing. Course::get('/path/{parameter}', 'VideoController@home', ['defaultParameterRegex' => '[\\w\\-]+']); You can also apply this setting to a group if you need multiple routes to use your custom regular expression when parsing parameters. Course::group(['defaultParameterRegex' => '[\\w\\-]+'], function() { Course::get('/path/{parameter}', 'VideoController@home'); }); Named routes Named routes allow the convenient generation of URLs or redirects for specific routes. You may specify a name for a route by chaining the name method onto the route definition: Course::get('/user/profile', function () { // Your code here })->name('profile'); You can also specify names for Controller-actions: Course::get('/user/profile', 'UserController@profile')->name('profile'); Generating URLs To Named Routes Once you have assigned a name to a given route, you may use the route's name when generating URLs or redirects via the global url helper-function (see helpers section): // Generating URLs... $url = url('profile'); If the named route defines parameters, you may pass the parameters as the second argument to the url function. The given parameters will automatically be inserted into the URL in their correct positions: Course::get('/user/{id}/profile', function ($id) { // })->name('profile'); $url = url('profile', ['id' => 1]); For more information on urls, please see the Urls section. Router groups Route groups allow you to share route attributes, such as middleware or namespaces, across a large number of routes without needing to define those attributes on each individual route. Shared attributes are specified in an array format as the first parameter to the Course::group method. Namespaces Solital already has the default namespace to search for controllers ( Solital\\Components\\Controller ) Note Group namespaces will only be added to routes with relative callbacks. For example if your route has an absolute callback like UserController@home , the namespace from the route will not be prepended. To fix this you can make the callback relative by removing the \\ in the beginning of the callback. Course::group(['namespace' => 'Admin'], function () { // Controllers Within The \"App\\Http\\Controllers\\Admin\" Namespace }); Subdomain-routing Route groups may also be used to handle sub-domain routing. Sub-domains may be assigned route parameters just like route urls, allowing you to capture a portion of the sub-domain for usage in your route or controller. The sub-domain may be specified using the domain key on the group attribute array: Course::group(['domain' => '{account}.myapp.com'], function () { Course::get('/user/{id}', function ($account, $id) { // }); }); Route prefixes The prefix group attribute may be used to prefix each route in the group with a given url. For example, you may want to prefix all route urls within the group with admin : Course::group(['prefix' => '/admin'], function () { Course::get('/users', function () { // Matches The \"/admin/users\" URL }); }); Partial groups Partial router groups has the same benefits as a normal group, but supports parameters and are only rendered once the url has matched. This can be extremely useful in situations, where you only want special routes to be added, when a certain criteria or logic has been met. NOTE: Use partial groups with caution as routes added within are only rendered and available once the url of the partial-group has matched. This can cause url() not to find urls for the routes added within. Example: Course::partialGroup('/admin/{applicationId}', function ($applicationId) { Course::get('/', function($applicationId) { // Matches The \"/admin/applicationId\" URL }); }); Exception ExceptionHandler are classes that handles all exceptions. ExceptionsHandlers must implement the ExceptionHandlerInterface interface. Error route If a given route does not exist in your routers.php file, you can redirect to another route instead of displaying the route not found error using the error() method. If true , the redirection will be done. If false , you will not be redirected. Course::error(true, '/error'); Course::get('/error', function () { echo 'error 404'; }); URL Rewriting Changing current route Sometimes it can be useful to manipulate the route about to be loaded. Solital allows you to easily manipulate and change the routes which are about to be rendered. All information about the current route is stored in the \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router instance's loadedRoute property. For easy access you can use the shortcut helper function request() instead of calling the class directly \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Course::router() . request()->setRewriteCallback('Example\\MyCustomClass@hello'); // -- or you can rewrite by url -- request()->setRewriteUrl('/my-rewrite-url'); Bootmanager: loading routes dynamically Sometimes it can be necessary to keep urls stored in the database, file or similar. In this example, we want the url /my-cat-is-beatiful to load the route /article/view/1 which the router knows, because it's defined in the routes.php file. To interfere with the router, we create a class that implements the RouterBootManagerInterface interface. This class will be loaded before any other rules in routes.php and allow us to \"change\" the current route, if any of our criteria are fulfilled (like coming from the url /my-cat-is-beatiful ). use Solital\\Core\\Http\\Request; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\RouterBootManagerInterface; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router; class CustomRouterRules implements RouterBootManagerInterface { /** * Called when router is booting and before the routes is loaded. * * @param \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router $router * @param \\Solital\\Core\\Http\\Request $request */ public function boot(\\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router $router, \\Solital\\Core\\Http\\Request $request): void { $rewriteRules = [ '/my-cat-is-beatiful' => '/article/view/1', '/horses-are-great' => '/article/view/2', ]; foreach ($rewriteRules as $url => $rule) { // If the current url matches the rewrite url, we use our custom route if ($request->getUri()->getPath() === $url) { $request->setRewriteUrl($rule); } } } } The above should be pretty self-explanatory and can easily be changed to loop through urls store in the database, file or cache. What happens is that if the current route matches the route defined in the index of our $rewriteRules array, we set the route to the array value instead. By doing this the route will now load the url /article/view/1 instead of /my-cat-is-beatiful . The last thing we need to do, is to add our custom boot-manager to the routes.php file. You can create as many bootmanagers as you like and easily add them in your routes.php file. Course::addBootManager(new CustomRouterRules()); Adding routes manually The Course class referenced in the previous example, is just a simple helper class that knows how to communicate with the Router class. If you are up for a challenge, want the full control or simply just want to create your own Router helper class, this example is for you. use \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Router; use \\Solital\\Core\\Course\\Route\\RouteUrl; /* Create new Router instance */ $router = new Router(); $route = new RouteUrl('/answer/1', function() { die('this callback will match /answer/1'); }); $route->addMiddleware(\\Demo\\Middlewares\\AuthMiddleware::class); $route->setNamespace('\\Demo\\Controllers'); $route->setPrefix('v1'); /* Add the route to the router */ $router->addRoute($route); Extending This is a simple example of an integration into a framework. The framework has it's own Router class which inherits from the Course class. This allows the framework to add custom functionality like loading a custom routes.php file or add debugging information etc. namespace Demo; use Solital\\Core\\Course\\Course; class Router extends Course { public static function start() { // change default namespace for all routes parent::setDefaultNamespace('\\Demo\\Controllers'); // change this to whatever makes sense in your project require_once 'routes.php'; // Do initial stuff parent::start(); } } Form Method Spoofing HTML forms do not support PUT , PATCH or DELETE actions. Therefore, when defining the PUT , PATCH or DELETE routes that are called from an HTML form, you will need to use the spoofing helper to add a hidden _method field to the form.

You easily use the url() shortcut helper function to retrieve urls for your routes or manipulate the current url. url() will return a Uri object which will return a string when rendered, so it can be used safely in templates etc. but contains all the useful helpers methods in the Uri class like contains , indexOf etc. Check the Useful url tricks below. Get the current url It has never been easier to get and/or manipulate the current url. The example below shows you how to get the current url: # output: /current-url url(); Get by name (single route) Course::get('/product-view/{id}', 'ProductsController@show', ['as' => 'product']); # output: /product-view/22/?category=shoes url('product', ['id' => 22], ['category' => 'shoes']); # output: /product-view/?category=shoes url('product', null, ['category' => 'shoes']); Get by name (controller route) Course::controller('/images', ImagesController::class, ['as' => 'picture']); # output: /images/view/?category=shows url('picture@getView', null, ['category' => 'shoes']); # output: /images/view/?category=shows url('picture', 'getView', ['category' => 'shoes']); # output: /images/view/ url('picture', 'view'); Get by class Course::get('/product-view/{id}', 'ProductsController@show', ['as' => 'product']); Course::controller('/images', 'ImagesController'); # output: /product-view/22/?category=shoes url('ProductsController@show', ['id' => 22], ['category' => 'shoes']); # output: /images/image/?id=22 url('ImagesController@getImage', null, ['id' => 22]); Using custom names for methods on a controller/resource route Course::controller('gadgets', GadgetsController::class, ['names' => ['getIphoneInfo' => 'iphone']]); url('gadgets.iphone'); # output # /gadgets/iphoneinfo/ Getting REST/resource controller urls Course::resource('/phones', PhonesController::class); # output: /phones/ url('phones'); # output: /phones/ url('phones.index'); # output: /phones/create/ url('phones.create'); # output: /phones/edit/ url('phones.edit'); Manipulating url You can easily manipulate the query-strings, by adding your get param arguments. # output: /current-url?q=cars url(null, null, ['q' => 'cars']); You can remove a query-string parameter by setting the value to null . The example below will remove any query-string parameter named q from the url but keep all others query-string parameters: $url = url()->removeParam('q'); Useful url tricks Calling url will always return a Url object.

The $arguments variable will have an array of values containing all arguments (if your custom command has no arguments, leave this variable empty). Lastly, the $description variable will have a short description of what the custom command does. Handle method The handle method will contain all the code that will be executed when executing the custom command and should always return a $this or, if necessary, another value. Using Arguments Arguments can be retrieved using the $arguments variable: php vinci user:cmd myArgument protected array $arguments = ['name']; public function handle(object $arguments, object $options): mixed { var_dump($arguments->foo); return $this; } Using Options Options are not defined in the created class, but you can check inside the handle method if an option exists. For example: php vinci user:cmd name --myOption public function handle(object $arguments, object $options): mixed { if (isset($options->myOption)) { # ... } return $this; } Input and output commands It is very common to enter an input value on the command line when needed. Using the InputOutput class, you can perform this action. use Solital\\Core\\Console\\InputOutput; (new InputOutput())->dialog('Enter a string: ')->action(function ($message) { echo $message .

With Wolf, you can display any HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. Wolf has the following features: generate views cache; extend other views; minify CSS and JS files; use native HTML files. You can load any template into the resource/views folder Basic To use the Wolf Template, you can use the view() helper, or create an instance of the Wolf class. use Solital\\Core\\Wolf\\Wolf; // With helper Course::get('/', function () { return view('welcome'); }); // With instance Course::get('/', function () { echo (new Wolf)->loadView('welcome'); }); Markers in Wolf Wolf uses markers to interpret PHP code within views. That is, when using {{ }} , Wolf will interpret these characters as <?= ?> . Likewise, when using {% %} , Wolf will interpret it as <?php ?> . That way, you can use native PHP code inside your views using the bookmarks. Parameters To display data for your view, use the second parameter of the view helper or loadView method. // With helper Course::get('/', function () { return view('welcome', [ 'title' => 'My Title' ]); }); // With instance Course::get('/', function () { echo (new Wolf)->loadView('welcome', [ 'title' => 'My Title' ]); }); And in your home.php , retrieve the value informed in this way: <title>{{ title }}</title> Loading CSS, JS and images Make sure the files exist in the folder public/assets/_css , public/assets/_js and public/assets/_img To load a CSS file, use the static load_css method in your template. <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ load_css('style.css'); }}\"> To load a JS file, use the static load_js method in your template. <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ load_js('file.js'); }}\"> To load a image file, use the static load_img method in your template. <img src=\"{{ load_img('image.png'); }}\"> To load a file outside the _css , _js and _img folder, use the load_file method. <img src=\"{{ load_file('path/for/your/file'); }}\"> Cache templates Cache on all pages If you have a template that takes a long time to load, or is rarely accessed, consider creating a cache of that template. Wolf's cache works as follows: a page is loaded, then a page identical to the one that was loaded with all the data already saved in cache is created. When reloading, if this page is still valid, the page's cache will be displayed. To cache your views, edit the bootstrap.yaml file: wolf_cache: enabled: true # false time: minute # minute, hour, day, week In time , you can define if you want to cache your views for 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day or 1 week. Cache on a single page If you don't want to create a cache file for all templates, consider using the WolfCache class to generate a cache file for each template. This class will create a cache file just for a single view (or for several if you add this class in the Controller's constructor). The syntax below shows how long the template can be cached. use Solital\\Core\\Wolf\\WolfCache; # The template is cached for one minute WolfCache::cache()->forOneMinute(); # The template is cached for an hour WolfCache::cache()->forOneHour(); # The template is cached for a day WolfCache::cache()->forOneDay(); # The template is cached for a week WolfCache::cache()->forOneWeek(); The code above shows how long the view will be cached. To actually generate the view cache, use the makeCache() method passing the template name as a parameter. Course::get('/', function () { WolfCache::cache()->forOneMinute()->makeCache('welcome'); return view('welcome'); }); Minify Assets Having to load multiple CSS and Javascript files can be a lot of work and can be a burden on the site. However, you can minify all of these files into a single CSS and JS file. By default, assets are loaded into the public/assets/ folder. However, there is a second assets folder inside specific resource/ to minify the CSS/JS files. If you want to generate a minified file for your assets, first add your CSS and JavaScript files to the resource/assets folder. Then edit the bootstrap.yaml file. wolf_minify: false style : minify only CSS files script : minify only JS files all : minify CSS and JS files false : don't minify files Load minified files into the template The load_min_css() and load_min_js() functions will load all files that are minified, without having to use the load_css() and load_js() functions. # Load minify CSS <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"{{ load_min_css() }}\"> # Load minify JS <script src=\"{{ load_min_js() }}\"><script> Extending templates It is very common for developers to create a header.php file and include it in other files. With Wolf this is also possible using the extend method. The extend method includes any template that is inside the resource/view folder. {% extend('header') %} It is not necessary to inform the file extension, just use the file home without the extension.
